ðŸ“ˆ CodeBoxx Odyssey - Week 12

The project was to create a smart contract consisting of 4 nodes using Solidity and Truffle.
The goal of the blockchain node is to ensure transparency and traceability when placing an order from one stage to another during its execution.

# Nodes:
```ssh
- Project Office:
Take the initial order of the contract and insert the number of Batteries, Columns, Elevators and Floors and convert them
into a list of parts Controllers, Axes, Doors, Buttons, Monitors and Speakers, with the necessary quantity of each one.

- Material Provider:
Recieves the list of parts needed and performs calculations to determine the materials needed to manufacture the order.

- Solution Manufacturing:
Production and assembly of necessary components based on the quantity of raw material and order received.

- Quality, Security and Homologation:
Receives the list of components and marks the elements with a certificate of conformity, permit and functional test.
```

# Client:

CodeBoxx Castle 725 Lebourgneuf, LÃ©vis, QC

Order:

  - 1 elevator battery

  - 2 columns

  - 4 excelium elevators per column to serve 5 ï¬‚oors

# About:

ðŸŽ¯ Each Node in the Rocket Elevators BlockChain will have to establish a Smart Contract that can be deployed on an ethereum network.

# How to set up the app

- run `npm install` from root folder
- cd to the 'client' folder & run `npm install` again
- ensure you have Ganache open and running on port 7545
- configure Metamask to use the same port, running on localhost
- run `truffle migrate` in the root folder
- run  `cd client && npm run start` - This start the React and should open the application in your browser.

# ðŸ“ŒMySQL:

We created a table in MySQL to keep track of the deployed contract, whit the name and addresses of contracts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ðŸ“ŒView:

We use drizzle to assist in the creation of our page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ðŸ“ŒRest API:

News endpoints created to insert and retrieve information in the database.
